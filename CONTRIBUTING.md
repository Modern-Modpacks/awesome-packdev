# Contribution Guidelines

Hey! Thank you for choosing to contribute! Here are some basic rules to abide by to keep it all nice and standardized:

* Put all suggestions in their respective categories and subcategories.
  * If you are unsure, add the suggestion to whatever category you see fit and mention this fact in your pull request.
  * You can add new sections if you so desire.
* Make sure your suggestion is not a duplicate.
* Keep lists alphabetically sorted.
* Follow this format for list items: `- [Name In Title Case](https://link-to-your-suggestions-web.site) - Description starting with a captial letter and ending with a period. <Any icons directly copied from the icon legend section>`
* Keep the descriptions breif and add no more than 3 icons.
  * If you have to add more, you are probably trying to pack in too much information. Remember, this list's main goal is to be short-but-awesome.
* Add ` (click for info)` at the end of an icon's hover text if you are also including a hyperlink attached to it.
* Check your suggestion for mistakes (grammatical/spelling/informational/whatever).
* Clearly describe what you've added in your PR. You are allowed to submit multiple suggestions at once.
