# Contribution Guidelines

Hey! Thank you for choosing to contribute! Here are some basic rules to abide by to keep it all nice and standardized:

* Put all suggestions in their respective categories and subcategories.
  * If you are unsure, add the suggestion to whatever category you see fit and mention this fact in your pull request.
  * You can add new sections if you so desire.
    * Sections names must be Title Case and can have icons attached.
* Make sure your suggestion is not a duplicate.
* Keep on-theme. If something is moddev-related instead of being packdev-related, don't add it.
* Keep lists alphabetically sorted.
* Check the "Temporary Modifications" section before editing the list, if such section exists.
* Follow this format for list items: `- [Name In Title Case](https://link-to-your-suggestions-web.site/) - Description starting with a captial letter and ending with a period, does not include an "A" in front of it (ex. "Something" instead of "A something"). <Any icons directly copied from the icon legend section>`
* Try to not use acronyms and abbrivations in the title/description unless their meanings are extremely obvious.
* All links should start with `https://` and have the `www.` subdomain truncated. If the link doesn't end in a file extension (ex. `.png`, `.html`, etc.), it should also end with a `/`.
* If the hyperlink points to a mod page, try to use the non-legacy CurseForge one (with the Forge/NeoForge versions if they and the Fabric/Quilt ones are separated into multiple projects). If the project doesn't exist on CurseForge (or if CurseForge page is abandoned), link the website where the up-to-date version of the mod is hosted.
* Keep the descriptions breif (about a sentence or two) and add no more than 5 icons.
  * If you have to add more, you are probably trying to pack in too much information. Remember, this list's main goal is to be short-but-awesome.
* Icons must have a space between each other and the text content. They also must be ordered in the same way as they are in the icon legend.
* Add ` (click for info)` at the end of an icon's hover text if you are also including a hyperlink attached to it.
* If you are using the modloader-exclusive icons in your suggestion, edit their hover and alt texts to say the correct modloader (ex. `[![quilt](icons/modloaders/fabric.png)](## "Quilt exclusive")` for quilt-exclusive mods).
* Check your suggestion for mistakes (grammatical/spelling/informational/whatever).
* Clearly describe what you've added in your PR. You are allowed to submit multiple suggestions at once.
